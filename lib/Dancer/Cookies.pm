=head1 NAME

Dancer::Cookies - a singleton storage for all cookies

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Dancer::Cookies;

    my $cookies = Dancer::Cookies->cookies;

    foreach my $name ( keys %{$cookies} ) {
        my $cookie = $cookies->{$name};
        my $value  = $cookie->value;
        print "$name => $value\n";
    }


    cookie lang => "fr-FR"; #set a cookie and return its value
    cookie lang => "fr-FR", expires => "2 hours";
    cookie "lang"           #return a cookie value

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dancer::Cookies keeps all the cookies defined by the application and makes them
accessible and provides a few helper functions for cookie handling with regards
to the stored cookies.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 init

This method is called when C<< ->new() >> is called. It creates a storage of
cookies parsed from the environment using C<parse_cookies_from_env> described
below.

=head2 cookies

Returns a hash reference of all cookies, all objects of L<Dancer::Cookie> type.

The key is the cookie name, the value is the L<Dancer::Cookie> object.

=head2 cookie

C<cookie> method is useful to query or set cookies easily.

    cookie lang => "fr-FR";              # set a cookie and return its value
    cookie lang => "fr-FR", expires => "2 hours";   # extra cookie info
    cookie "lang"                        # return a cookie value

=head2 parse_cookie_from_env

Fetches all the cookies from the environment, parses them and creates a hashref
of all cookies.

It also returns all the hashref it created.
