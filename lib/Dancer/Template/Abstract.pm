=head1 NAME

Dancer::Template::Abstract - abstract class for Dancer's template engines

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is provided as a base class for each template engine. Any template
engine must inherit from it and provide a set of methods described below.

=head1 TEMPLATE TOKENS

By default Dancer injects some tokens (or variables) to templates. The
available tokens are:

=over 4

=item C<perl_version>

The current running Perl version.

=item C<dancer_version>

The current running Dancer version.

=item C<settings>

Hash to access current application settings.

=item C<request>

Hash to access your current request.

=item C<params>

Hash to access your request parameters.

=item C<vars>

Hash to access your defined variables (using C<vars>).

=item C<session>

Hash to access your session (if you have session enabled)

=back

=head1 INTERFACE

=over 4

=item B<init()>

The template engine can overload this method if some initialization stuff has to
be done before the template engine is used.

The base class provides a plain init() method that only returns true.

=item B<default_tmpl_ext()>

Template class that inherits this class should override this method to return a default template
extension, example: for Template::Toolkit it returns "tt" and for HTML::Mason it returns "mason".
So when you call C<template 'index';> in your dispatch code, Dancer will look for a file 'index.tt'
or 'index.mason' based on the template you use.

Note 1: when returning the extension string, please do not add a dot in front of the extension
as Dancer will do that.

Note 2: for backwards compatibility abstract class returns "tt" instead of throwing
an exception 'method not implemented'.

User would be able to change the default extension using the
C<<extension>> configuration variable on the template
configuration. For example, for the default (C<Simple>) engine:

     template: "simple"
     engines:
       simple:
         extension: 'tmpl'

=item B<view($view)>

The default behavior of this method is to return the path of the given view,
appending the default template extension (either the value of the C<extension>
setting in the configuration, or the value returned by C<default_tmpl_ext>) if
it is not present in the view name given and no layout template with that exact
name existed.  (In other words, given a layout name C<main>, if C<main> exists
in the layouts dir, it will be used; if not, C<main.tmpl> (where C<tmpl> is the
value of the C<extension> setting, or the value returned by C<default_tmpl_ext>)
will be looked for.)

=item B<view_exists($view_path)>

By default, Dancer::Template::Abstract checks to see if it can find the
view file calling C<view_exists($path_to_file)>. If not, it will
generate a nice error message for the user.

If you are using extending Dancer::Template::Abstract to use a template
system with multiple document roots (like L<Text::XSlate> or
L<Template>), you can override this method to always return true, and
therefore skip this check.

=item B<layout($layout, $tokens, $content)>

The default behavior of this method is to merge a content with a layout.  The
layout file is looked for with similar logic as per C<view> - an exact match
first, then attempting to append the default template extension, if the view
name given did not already end with it.

=item B<render($self, $template, $tokens)>

This method must be implemented by the template engine. Given a template and a
set of tokens, it returns a processed string.

If C<$template> is a reference, it's assumed to be a reference to a string that
contains the template itself. If it's not a reference, it's assumed to be the
path to template file, as a string. The render method will then have to open it
and read its content (Dancer::FileUtils::read_file_content does that job).

This method's return value must be a string which is the result of the
interpolation of C<$tokens> in C<$template>.

If an error occurs, the method should trigger an exception with C<die()>.

Examples :

    # with a template as a file
    $content = $engine->render('/my/template.txt', { var => 42 };

    # with a template as a scalar
    my $template = "here is <% var %>";
    $content = $engine->render(\$template, { var => 42 });
