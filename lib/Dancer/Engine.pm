=head1 NAME

Dancer::Engine - base class for Dancer engines

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $engine = Dancer::Engine->build( Serializer => 'JSON', $configuration );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dancer has various engines such Serializer engines, Template engines, Logger
engines and Session handlers engines. This is the base class for all Dancer
engines.

If you're writing an engine of a common type (such as those mentioned above),
you probably want to simply use their base class, which in turn use
L<Dancer::Engine>. For example, Template engines inherit from
L<Dancer::Template::Abstract> and Serializer engines inherit from
L<Dancer::Serializer::Abstract>. Those I<Abstract> base classes inherit from
L<Dancer::Engine>.

If a new type of Dancer engine is created, it is best it inherits from this
class.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 name

The name of the engine, such as I<JSON>, or I<Simple>.

=head2 type

The type of the engine, such as I<Serializer>, or I<Session>.

=head1 METHODS/SUBROUTINES

=head2 config

Fetches the configuration of the engine.

    my $configuration = $engine->config;

You can B<only> set the configuration at initialization time, not after.

=head2 build

Builds and returns the engine.

    my $engine = Dancer::Engine->build( $type => $name, $config );
