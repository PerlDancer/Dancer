=head1 NAME

Dancer::Object::Singleton - Singleton base class for Dancer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package My::Dancer::Extension;

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use base 'Dancer::Object::Singleton';

    __PACKAGE__->attributes( qw/name value this that/ );

    sub init {
        my ($class, $instance) = @_;
        # our initialization code, if we need one
    }

    # .. later on ..

    # returns the unique instance
    my $singleton_intance = My::Dancer::Extension->instance();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dancer::Object::Singleton is meant to be used instead of Dancer::Object, if you
want your object to be a singleton, that is, a class that has only one instance
in the application.

It provides you with attributes and an initializer.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 instance

Returns the instance of the singleton. The instance is created only when
needed. The creation will call the C<init()> method, which you should implement.

=head2 init

Exists but does nothing. This is so you won't have to write an initializer if
you don't want to. init receives the instance as argument.

=head2 get_attributes

Get the attributes of the specific class.

=head2 attributes

Generates attributes for whatever object is extending Dancer::Object and saves
them in an internal hashref so they can be later fetched using
C<get_attributes>.
