=head1 NAME

Dancer::Session::Abstract - abstract class for session engine

=head1 SPEC

=over 4

=item B<role>

A Dancer::Session object represents a session engine and should provide anything
needed to manipulate a session, whatever its storing engine is.

=item B<id>

The session id will be written to a cookie, named C<dancer.session>, it is
assumed that a client must accept cookies to be able to use a session-aware
Dancer webapp.

=item B<storage engine>

When the session engine is enabled, a I<before> filter takes care to initialize
the good Dancer::Session::Engine (according to the setting C<session>).

Then, the filter looks for a cookie named C<dancer.session> in order to
I<retrieve> the current session object. If not found, a new session object is
I<created> and its id written to the cookie.

Whenever a session call is made within a route handler, the singleton
representing the current session object is modified.

After terminating the request, a I<flush> is made to the session object.

=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This virtual class describes how to build a session engine for Dancer. This is
done in order to allow multiple session storage with a common interface.

Any session engine must inherits from Dancer::Session::Abstract and implement
the following abstract methods.

The default session name is "dancer_session". This can be set in your config file:

    setting session_name: "mydancer_session"

=head2 Abstract Methods

=over 4

=item B<retrieve($id)>

Look for a session with the given id, return the session object if found, undef
if not.

=item B<create()>

Create a new session, return the session object.

=item B<flush()>

Write the session object to the storage engine.

=item B<destroy()>

Remove the current session object from the storage engine.

=item B<session_name> (optional)

Returns a string with the name of cookie used for storing the session ID.

=back

=head2 Inherited Methods

The following methods are not supposed to be overloaded, they are generic and
should be OK for each session engine.

=over 4

=item B<build_id>

Build a new uniq id.

=item B<read_session_id>

Reads the C<dancer.session> cookie.

=item B<write_session_id>

Write the current session id to the C<dancer.session> cookie.
