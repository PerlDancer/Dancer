=head1 NAME

Dancer::Session::Abstract - abstract class for session engine

=head1 SPEC

=over 4

=item B<role>

A Dancer::Session object represents a session engine and should provide anything
needed to manipulate a session, whatever its storing engine is.

=item B<id>

The session id will be written to a cookie, by default named C<dancer.session>, 
it is assumed that a client must accept cookies to be able to use a 
session-aware Dancer webapp. (The cookie name can be change using the
C<session_name> config setting.)

=item B<storage engine>

When the session engine is enabled, a I<before> filter takes care to initialize
the appropriate session engine (according to the setting C<session>).

Then, the filter looks for a cookie named C<dancer.session> (or whatever you've
set the C<session_name> setting to, if you've used it) in order to
I<retrieve> the current session object. If not found, a new session object is
I<created> and its id written to the cookie.

Whenever a session call is made within a route handler, the singleton
representing the current session object is modified.

A I<flush> is made to the session object after every modification unless
the session engine overrides the C<is_lazy> method to return true.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This virtual class describes how to build a session engine for Dancer. This is
done in order to allow multiple session storage backends with a common interface.

Any session engine must inherit from Dancer::Session::Abstract and implement
the following abstract methods.

=head2 Configuration

These settings control how a session acts.

=head3 session_name

The default session name is "dancer_session". This can be set in your config file:

    setting session_name: "mydancer_session"

=head3 session_domain

Allows you to set the domain property on the cookie, which will
override the default.  This is useful for setting the session cookie's
domain to something like C<.domain.com> so that the same cookie will
be applicable and usable across subdomains of a base domain.

=head3 session_secure

The user's session id is stored in a cookie.  If true, this cookie
will be made "secure" meaning it will only be served over https.

=head3 session_expires

When the session should expire.  The format is either the number of
seconds in the future, or the human readable offset from
L<Dancer::Cookie/expires>.

By default, there is no expiration.

=head3 session_is_http_only

This setting defaults to 1 and instructs the session cookie to be
created with the C<HttpOnly> option active, meaning that JavaScript
will not be able to access to its value.

=head2 Abstract Methods

=over 4

=item B<retrieve($id)>

Look for a session with the given id, return the session object if found, undef
if not.

=item B<create()>

Create a new session, return the session object.

=item B<flush()>

Write the session object to the storage engine.

=item B<destroy()>

Remove the current session object from the storage engine.

=item B<session_name> (optional)

Returns a string with the name of cookie used for storing the session ID.

You should probably not override this; the user can control the cookie name
using the C<session_name> setting.

=back

=head2 Inherited Methods

The following methods are not supposed to be overloaded, they are generic and
should be OK for each session engine.

=over 4

=item B<build_id>

Build a new uniq id.

=item B<read_session_id>

Reads the C<dancer.session> cookie.

=item B<write_session_id>

Write the current session id to the C<dancer.session> cookie.

=item B<is_lazy>

Default is false.  If true, session data will not be flushed after every
modification and the session engine (or application) will need to ensure
that a flush is called before the end of the request.
