=head1 NAME

Dancer::Object - Objects base class for Dancer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package My::Dancer::Extension;

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use base 'Dancer::Object';

    __PACKAGE__->attributes( qw/name value this that/ );

    sub init {
        # our initialization code, if we need one
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

While we B<love> L<Moose>, we can't use it for Dancer and still keep Dancer
minimal, so we wrote Dancer::Object instead.

It provides you with attributes and an initializer.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Creates a new object of whatever is based off Dancer::Object. This is a generic
C<new> method so you don't have to write one yourself when extending
C<Dancer::Object>.

It accepts arguments in a hash and runs an additional C<init> method (described
below) which you should implement.

=head2 init

Exists but does nothing. This is so you won't have to write an initializer if
you don't want to.

=head2 clone

Creates and returns a clone of the object using L<Clone>, which is loaded
dynamically. If we cannot load L<Clone>, we throw an exception.

=head2 get_attributes

Get the attributes of the specific class.

=head2 attributes

Generates attributes for whatever object is extending Dancer::Object and saves
them in an internal hashref so they can be later fetched using
C<get_attributes>.

For each defined attribute you can access its value using:

  $self->your_attribute_name;

To set a value use

  $self->your_attribute_name($value);

Nevertheless, you can continue to use these attributes as hash keys,
as usual with blessed hash references:

  $self->{your_attribute_name} = $value;

Although this is possible we defend you should use the method
approach, as it maintains compatibility in case C<Dancer::Object>
structure changes in the future.

=head2 attributes_defaults

  $self->attributes_defaults(length => 2);

given a hash (not a hashref), makes sure an object has the given attributes
default values. Usually called from within an C<init> function.
