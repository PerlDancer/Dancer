Dancer 1.1999_03 (RC3)
    [Alexis Sukrieh]
    * Transparent unicode support
      Dancer now takes care transparently of decoding unicode strings
      used within route handlers and encoding them back before sending
      a response content. Once the 'charset' setting is set, the user
      has nothing more to do to have a working unicode-aware application.
    * FIX for issue #172
      More documentation added to Dancer::Request, all public method
      are documented. A pod coverage test has been added for this
      module.
    * Documentation update The deployment documentation is more precise about
      cgi/fast-cgi deployment under Apache.
    * FIX for issue GH#171
      Scaffolded configuration files are fully commented in order to quickly
      guide the user in her first steps.

Dancer 1.1999_02 (RC2)

    [ Mark Allen ]
    * Add a tutorial (Dancer::Tutorial)
    * example application 'Dancr', provided in example/

    [ Franck Cuny ]
    * Dancer::Test load D::Session::Simple
    * rewrite how Dancer handle HTTP headers
      - no more Dancer::Headers
      - all headers are HTTP::Headers object

    [ Philippe Bruhat ]
    * use Pod::Usage

    [ Damien Krotkine ]
    * replace all die and warn with croak and carp

    [ Alexis Sukrieh ]
    * FIX for issue GH #151
      utf8 pragma is imported automatically when Dancer is loaded
      to allow the usage of UTF-8 strings in the application code.
      (Thanks to kocoureasy for the report).
    * FIX for "UTF-8" issues (GH#153):
      - response content is encoded only if content_type is text
      - charset setting is normalized to UTF-8 when appropriate
      - automatically decode UTF-8 strings in params
    * FIX scaffolded dispatchers (script/dancer)
      The PLACK_ENV variable is not propagated by Apoache to the dispatchers (at
      least with our Deployment examples) so the dispatchers aren't aware of the
      PSGI context if we don't tell them explicitly.
      This patch forces the dispatchers in PSGI mode.
    * FIX (unknown bug)
      When a serializer is set and show_errors is true, don't expose internal
      errors caught.

    [ Naveen ]
    * add --version to the dancer CLI
    * changed the URI fetched by the dancer script to check Dancer's version

Dancer 1.1999_01 (RC1)

    [ Alexis Sukrieh ]
    * FIX for utf8 content in views
      Dancer now handles correctly templates with non-ASCII characters in views.
      All you have to do is to set the "charset" setting in your config. Your
      content response will then be encoded appropriately on-the-fly by Dancer.
    * Scaffolded app sets the charset to "utf8" by default.
    * Better design for the scaffolded app (logo, favicon and background image
      added)
    * Environment info available on scaffolded app 
    * LWP is used by the dancer helper to download files
    * jQuery 1.4.2 (minified) is included in the scaffolded app
    * default layout uses <% request.base %> in order to support mounted apps
      (Thanks to Naveed Massjouni and Franck Cuny for the concept/idea).
    * The main.tt layout sources jQuery first from Google CDN and falls back to
      the local minified version if on offline mode.
    * New default token provided to the "template" helper: dancer_version
    
    [ Sebastian de Castelberg ]
    * The dancer helper is able to download files via a transparent proxy
      (thanks to LWP).

    [ Adam J. Foxson ]
    * FIX for issue GH#136: 
      "readline() on closed filehandle DATA" error that appears when running
      the app with Starman
    
    [ Naveed Massjouni ]
    * Dancer::Test function get_response is renamed to dancer_response
      get_response still works but is deprecated
    * dispatch.f?cgi scripts use FindBin to resolve their location.
      FIX a bug when using symlinks.

    [ Franck Cuny ]
    * FIX for issue GH#129 
      don't add multiple content-type to headers
    * fix broken tests (they were testing incorrect content type)

    [ Damien Krotkine ]
    * FIX for issue GH#115
      documentation about compression in Dancer::Deployment 
    
    [ David Precious ]
    * Make the 'layout' param to the template keyword work as you'd expect and
      allow you to set a custom layout to use, e.g.:
      template 'templatename', {}, { layout => 'layoutname' };
 
    [ Philippe Bruhat ]
    * Make sure a plugin refuse to register a keyword twice

    [ Sawyer X ]
    * Lots of documentation updates
    * Dancer now logs caught crashes in rendering
      (easier to debug Ajax routes)

Dancer 1.1904
    [ Sawyer X, Franck Cuny ]
    * SAX, not Sax.
    * Check for XML::Parser or XML::SAX in test as well.

Dancer 1.1903
    [ Sawyer X, Franck Cuny ]
    * XML::Simple needs either XML::SAX or XML::Parser.
      (fixed test fails from Dancer::Serializer::XML)

    [ Adam J. Foxson ]
    * Addresses issue #136: "readline() on closed filehandle DATA"

Dancer 1.1901 (1.2RC0)

    [ Franck Cuny ]
    * implemented GH#120:
      - methods {to,from}_{xml,json,yaml} accept more than one arguments. The
        first argument is the data to transform. All the remainings arguments
        are parameters to alter the behavior of the serializers. Refer to the
        documentation for more informations.
    * more tests added

    [ Alexis Sukrieh ]
    * load_plugin is DEPRECATED; 'use' should be used instead to load a plugin.
      This is fixes the major issue with plugins about symbol exports that
      didn't work well (issue #101).
    * All paths built in a scaffolded application are dynamic, it's now
      possible to move a scaffolded application after it's been generated.
      (fixes issues #88, 
    * The auto_reload feature is now disabled by default due to too many
      unsolved issues (it works most of the time, but some race conditions are
      still present) This feature is still being working on, but it's now
      flagged "experimental").  
    * Default log level in development environment is now 'core' in order to
      provide more information.
    * New scaffolded application design. More neutral and with lots of
      information for a beginner, and links to useful material.
      Based on the Ruby on Rails start page (kudos to the Rails team,
      http://www.rubyonrails.org).

    [ Boris Shomodjvarac ]

    * Logger engines don't have anymore to implement _format(), they can use
      $self->format_message instead.
    * New log level: "core" for letting Dancer's core express itself on crucial
      events.
      That way, when the app config sets log to "core", any core messages is
      sent to the logger, and the end-user can see which route is chosen for
      each request received.
      Thanks to Gabor Szabo for the idea.
    * New class Dancer::Timer added so any logger engine can now show a timer
      string.
    * Scaffolded applications are now built like a CPAN distribution, with a
      Makefile.PL
      and test scripts (thanks to Gabor Szabo for the idea).

          params, query string params and body params so the

          params instead of dealing with a mixed structure.
