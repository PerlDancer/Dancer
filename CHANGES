	[ Yanick Champoux ]
	* Doc fix.

Dancer 1.1999_03 (RC3)
	[ Alexis Sukrieh ]
	* Transparent unicode support
	  Dancer now takes care transparently of decoding unicode strings
	  used within route handlers and encoding them back before sending
	  a response content. Once the 'charset' setting is set, the user
	  has nothing more to do to have a working unicode-aware application.
	* FIX for issue #172
	  More documentation added to Dancer::Request, all public method
	  are documented. A pod coverage test has been added for this
	  module.
	* Documentation update The deployment documentation is more precise about
	  cgi/fast-cgi deployment under Apache.
	* FIX for issue GH#171
	  Scaffolded configuration files are fully commented in order to quickly
	  guide the user in her first steps.

	[ Damien Krotkine ]
	* Fix Dancer::Plugin OO issue

	[ Danijel Tasov ]
	* Fixed expires in cookies + tests

	  hashref is now deprecated)

	[ Dave Doyle ]
	* clarify Pod as to how before_template works

	[ Sawyer X ]
	* Overhaul tests to use lib t/lib instead of t::lib::.
	  (fixes Windows test fails)
	* PSGI envs on Windows is in capital letters.
	  (fixes Windows test fails)
	* Add tests on every required directory to create a fake environment.
	  (realpath() on Windows fails when path doesn't exist)

	* example application 'Dancr', provided in example/

	[ Franck Cuny ]

	* use Pod::Usage

	[ Damien Krotkine ]
	* replace all die and warn with croak and carp

	[ Alexis Sukrieh ]
	* FIX for issue GH #151
	  utf8 pragma is imported automatically when Dancer is loaded
	  to allow the usage of UTF-8 strings in the application code.
	  (Thanks to kocoureasy for the report).
	* FIX for "UTF-8" issues (GH#153):
	  - response content is encoded only if content_type is text
	  - charset setting is normalized to UTF-8 when appropriate
	  - automatically decode UTF-8 strings in params
	* FIX scaffolded dispatchers (script/dancer)
	  The PLACK_ENV variable is not propagated by Apoache to the dispatchers (at
	  least with our Deployment examples) so the dispatchers aren't aware of the
	  PSGI context if we don't tell them explicitly.
	  This patch forces the dispatchers in PSGI mode.
	* FIX (unknown bug)
	  When a serializer is set and show_errors is true, don't expose internal
	  errors caught.

	[ Naveen ]
	* add --version to the dancer CLI
	* changed the URI fetched by the dancer script to check Dancer's version

Dancer 1.1999_01 (RC1)

	[ Alexis Sukrieh ]
	* FIX for utf8 content in views
	  Dancer now handles correctly templates with non-ASCII characters in views.
	  All you have to do is to set the "charset" setting in your config. Your
	  content response will then be encoded appropriately on-the-fly by Dancer.
	* Scaffolded app sets the charset to "utf8" by default.
	* Better design for the scaffolded app (logo, favicon and background image
	  added)
	* Environment info available on scaffolded app
	* LWP is used by the dancer helper to download files
	* jQuery 1.4.2 (minified) is included in the scaffolded app
	* default layout uses <% request.base %> in order to support mounted apps
	  (Thanks to Naveed Massjouni and Franck Cuny for the concept/idea).
	* The main.tt layout sources jQuery first from Google CDN and falls back to
	  the local minified version if on offline mode.
	* New default token provided to the "template" helper: dancer_version

	[ Sebastian de Castelberg ]
	* The dancer helper is able to download files via a transparent proxy
	  (thanks to LWP).

	[ Adam J. Foxson ]
	* FIX for issue GH#136:
	  "readline() on closed filehandle DATA" error that appears when running
	  the app with Starman

	[ Naveed Massjouni ]
	* Dancer::Test function get_response is renamed to dancer_response
	  get_response still works but is deprecated
	* dispatch.f?cgi scripts use FindBin to resolve their location.
	  FIX a bug when using symlinks.

	[ Franck Cuny ]
	* FIX for issue GH#129
	  don't add multiple content-type to headers
	* fix broken tests (they were testing incorrect content type)

	[ Damien Krotkine ]
	* FIX for issue GH#115
	  documentation about compression in Dancer::Deployment

	[ David Precious ]
	* Make the 'layout' param to the template keyword work as you'd expect and
	  allow you to set a custom layout to use, e.g.:
	  template 'templatename', {}, { layout => 'layoutname' };

	[ Philippe Bruhat ]
	* Make sure a plugin refuse to register a keyword twice

	[ Sawyer X ]
	* Lots of documentation updates
	* Dancer now logs caught crashes in rendering
	  (easier to debug Ajax routes)

Dancer 1.1904

	* SAX, not Sax.
	* Check for XML::Parser or XML::SAX in test as well.

Dancer 1.1903
	[ Sawyer X, Franck Cuny ]
	* XML::Simple needs either XML::SAX or XML::Parser.
	  (fixed test fails from Dancer::Serializer::XML)

	* Addresses issue #136: "readline() on closed filehandle DATA"

Dancer 1.1901 (1.2RC0)

	[ Franck Cuny ]
	* implemented GH#120:

	    first argument is the data to transform. All the remainings arguments
	    are parameters to alter the behavior of the serializers. Refer to the
	    documentation for more informations.
	* more tests added

	[ Alexis Sukrieh ]
	* load_plugin is DEPRECATED; 'use' should be used instead to load a plugin.
	  This is fixes the major issue with plugins about symbol exports that
	  didn't work well (issue #101).
	* All paths built in a scaffolded application are dynamic, it's now
	  possible to move a scaffolded application after it's been generated.
	  (fixes issues #88,
	* The auto_reload feature is now disabled by default due to too many
	  unsolved issues (it works most of the time, but some race conditions are
	  still present) This feature is still being working on, but it's now
	  flagged "experimental").
	* Default log level in development environment is now 'core' in order to
	  provide more information.
	* New scaffolded application design. More neutral and with lots of
	  information for a beginner, and links to useful material.
	  Based on the Ruby on Rails start page (kudos to the Rails team,
	  http://www.rubyonrails.org).

	  $appname.pl script (FIX for RT #54759).
	* FIX for issue #34
	  No more warnings undeer Win32 for tests script that needs a tempdir
	* FIX (unknown bug)
	  The standalone server now parses commandline options (was broken

	  alternate location.
	* Core settings can be initialized via environment
	  variables, prefixed with "DANCER_" (e.g.  "DANCER_DAEMON"

	  rather than when the handler is initialized.
	* Routes are compiled at startup instead of being compiled whenever a
	  request is handled.  This can increase performances up to 50%.

	  is needed by the pattern.

	      params instead of dealing with a mixed structure.
	    + Added accessors to referer and remote_address
	* The Standalone server now uses the setting 'server' to
	  bind itself to the IP address given by the setting.
